Type Promotion In Dart
    Type promotion in dart means that dart automatically converts a value of one type to another type. Dart does this when it knows that the value is of a specific type.

How Type Promotion Works In Dart?
    Types Promotion in Dart works in the following ways:

    - Promoting from general types to specific subtypes.
    - Promoting from nullable types to non-nullable types.  


Example 1: Promoting From General Types To Specific Subtypes
    In this example, the variable name is declared as an Object. The Object class doesnâ€™t have a .length property. Variable name gets promoted from Object to String so that you can access the .length property of the String class.

    void main(){
    Object name = "Pratik";
    // print(name.length) will not work because Dart doesn't know that name is a String

    if(name is String) {
    // name promoted from Object to String
    print("The length of name is ${name.length}");
    }
    }    


Example 4: Type Promotion With Nullable Type To Non-Nullable Type
    In this example, the variable value contains a value of type String or null. The variable value is promoted to a non-nullable type String in the if block. If the variable value is null, then the else block is executed.

// importing dart:math library
import 'dart:math';
// creating a class DataProvider
class DataProvider{
    // creating a method stringorNull
    String? get stringorNull => Random().nextBool() ? "Hello" : null;

    // creating a method myMethod
    void myMethod(){
        String? value = stringorNull;
        // checking if value String or not
        if(value is String){
            print("The length of value is ${value.length}");
        }else{
            print("The value is not string.");
        }

    }
}
// main method
void main() {
    DataProvider().myMethod();
}

Show Output:
The length of value is 5
 
Note: The output of the above example is random. It can be either The length of value is 5 or The value is not string.
