Basic Dart Program For Printing Name
void main()
{
    var name = "John";
    print(name);
}

Basic Dart Program Explained:
    void main() is the starting point where the execution of your program begins.

    Every program starts with a main function.
    
    The curly braces {} represent the beginning and the ending of a block of code.

    Each code statement must end with a semicolon.

Dart Program To Join One Or More Variables:
    Here $variableName is used to join variables. This joining process in dart is called string interpolation.

void main(){
  var firstName = "John";
  var lastName = "Doe";
  print("Full name is $firstName $lastName");
}

Dart Program For Basic Calculation:
Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in dart.

void main() {
int num1 = 10; //declaring number1
int num2 = 3; //declaring number2
  
// Calculation
int sum = num1 + num2;
int diff = num1 - num2;
int mul = num1 * num2;
double div = num1 / num2; // It is double because it outputs number with decimal.
  
// displaying the output
print("The sum is $sum");
print("The diff is $diff");
print("The mul is $mul");
print("The div is $div");
}
