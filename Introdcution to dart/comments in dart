Comments:
    Comments are the set of statements that are ignored by the dart compiler during program execution. 
    They are used to explain the code so that you or other people can understand it easily.

Advantages Of Comments:
    You can describe your code.
    Other people will understand your code more clearly.

Types Of Comments:
    Single-Line Comment: For commenting on a single line of code. 
        E.g: 
            void main() {
            // This is single-line comment.
            print("Welcome to Technology Channel.");
            }

    Multi-Line Comment: For commenting on multiple lines of code. E.g. /* This is a multi-line comment. */
        E.g:
            void main(){  
            /*
            This is a multi-line comment.
            */
                print("Welcome to Technology Channel.");  
            }
