Operators In Dart:
    Operators are used to perform mathematical and logical operations on the variables. 
    Each operation in dart uses a symbol called the operator to denote the type of operation it performs. 
    Before learning operators in the dart, you must understand the following things.

    Operands : It represents the data.
    Operator : It represents how the operands will be processed to produce a value.
    
    Note: Suppose the given expression is 2 + 3. Here 2 and 3 are operands, and + is the operator.


Increment and Decrement Operators:
    With increment and decrement operators, you can increase and decrease values. If ++ is used at the beginning, then it is a prefix. If it is used at last, then it is postfix.

    Operator Symbol |   Operator Name   |	Description
    ++var	            Pre Increment	    Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var+1
    --var	            Pre Decrement	    Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var-1
    var++	            Post Increment	    Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var
    var--	            Post Decrement	    Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var
    
    Note: ++var increases the value of operands, whereas var++ returns the actual value of operands before the increment.


Assignment Operators:
    It is used to assign some values to variables. Here, we are assigning 24 to the age variable.

    int age = 24;

    Operator Type   |	Description
    =	                Assign a value to a variable
    +=	                Adds a value to a variable
    -=	                Reduces a value to a variable
    *=	                Multiply value to a variable
    /=	                Divided value by a variable


    void main() {
    double age = 24;
    age+= 1;  // Here age+=1 means age = age + 1.
    print("After Addition Age is $age");
    age-= 1;  //Here age-=1 means age = age - 1.
    print("After Subtraction Age is $age");
    age*= 2;  //Here age*=2 means age = age * 2.
    print("After Multiplication Age is $age");
    age/= 2;  //Here age/=2 means age = age / 2.
    print("After Division Age is $age");
    }    


Logical Operators:
    It is used to compare values.

    Operator Type   |	Description
    &&	                This is ‘and’, return true if all conditions are true
    ||	                This is ‘or’. Return true if one of the conditions is true
    !	                This is ’not’. return false if the result is true and vice versa
