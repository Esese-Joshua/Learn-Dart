String In Dart:
    String helps you to store text based data. In String, you can represent your name, address, or complete book. It holds a series or sequence of characters – letters, numbers, and special characters. You can use single or double, or triple quotes to represent String.

Example: String In Dart
    Single line String is written in single or double quotes, whereas multi-line strings are written in triple quotes. 


String Concatenation:
    You can combine one String with another string. This is called concatenation. In Dart, you can use the + operator or use interpolation to concatenate the String. Interpolation makes it easy to read and understand the code.

    void main() {   
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
    print("Using +, Full Name is "+firstName + " " + lastName+".");
    print("Using interpolation, full name is $firstName $lastName.");  
    
    }
