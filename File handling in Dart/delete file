Delete File In Dart:
    Assume that you have a file named test.txt in the same directory of your dart program. Now, letâ€™s delete it.

    // dart program to delete file
    import 'dart:io';

    void main() {
    // open file
    File file = File('test.txt');
    // delete file
    file.deleteSync();
    print('File deleted.');
    }

    Show Output
    Note: If you try to delete a file that does not exist, then it will throw an exception.



You can use File.existsSync() method to check if a file exists or not. If it exists, then you can delete it.

  // dart program to delete file if exists
  import 'dart:io';

  void main() {
    // open file
    File file = File('test.txt');
    // check if file exists
    if (file.existsSync()) {
      // delete file
      file.deleteSync();
      print('File deleted.');
    } else {
      print('File does not exist.');
    }
  }
