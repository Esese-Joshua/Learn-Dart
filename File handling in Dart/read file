Read File In Dart:
    Assume that you have a file named test.txt in the same directory of your dart program.

    Welcome to test.txt file.
    This is a test file.
    
Now, you can read this file using File class and readAsStringSync() method.

// dart program to read from file
    import 'dart:io';

    void main() {
    // creating file object
    File file = File('test.txt');
    // read file
    String contents = file.readAsStringSync();
    // print file
    print(contents);
    }


Get File Information:
  In this example below, you will learn how to get file information like file location, file size, and last modified time.

    import 'dart:io';

    void main() {
      // open file
      File file = File('test.txt');
      // get file location
      print('File path: ${file.path}');
      // get absolute path
      print('File absolute path: ${file.absolute.path}');
      // get file size
      print('File size: ${file.lengthSync()} bytes');
      // get last modified time
      print('Last modified: ${file.lastModifiedSync()}');
    }

    Note: If you try to get information of a file that does not exist, then it will throw an exception.
