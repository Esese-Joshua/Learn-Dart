Add New Content To Previous Content:
    You can use FileMode.append to add new content to previous content. Assume that test.txt file already contains some text.

        Welcome to test.txt file.
            
    Now, letâ€™s add new content to it.

    // dart program to write to existing file
    import 'dart:io';

    void main() {
    // open file
    File file =  File('test.txt');
    // write to file
    file.writeAsStringSync('\nThis is a new content.', mode: FileMode.append);
    print('Congratulations!! New content is added on top of previous content.');
    }
    Show Output
    Congratulations!! New content is added on top of previous content.


Write CSV File In Dart:
    In the example below, we will ask user to enter name and phone of 3 students and write it to a csv file named students.csv.    

    // dart program to write to csv file
    import 'dart:io';

    void main() {
    // open file
    File file = File("students.csv");
    // write to file
    file.writeAsStringSync('Name,Phone\n');
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        // user input name
        stdout.write("Enter name of student ${i + 1}: ");
        String? name = stdin.readLineSync();
        stdout.write("Enter phone of student ${i + 1}: ");
        // user input phone
        String? phone = stdin.readLineSync();
        file.writeAsStringSync('$name,$phone\n', mode: FileMode.append);
    }
    print("Congratulations!! CSV file written successfully.");
    }

    Show Output:
    Enter name of student 1: John 
    Enter phone of student 1: 1234567890
    Enter name of student 2: Mark
    Enter phone of student 2: 0123456789
    Enter name of student 3: Elon
    Enter phone of student 3: 0122112322
    Congratulations!! CSV file written successfully.
    
    students.csv file will look like this:
    Name,Phone
    John,1234567890
    Mark,0123456789
    Elon,0122112322
