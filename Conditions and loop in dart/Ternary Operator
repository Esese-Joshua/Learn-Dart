Ternary Operator:
    The ternary operator is like if-else statement. 
    This is a one-liner replacement for the if-else statement. It is used to write a conditional expression, where based on the result of a boolean condition, one of the two values is selected.

    Example Using If Else
    This program finds greatest number between two numbers using if else.

        void main() {
        int num1 = 10;
        int num2 = 15;
        int max = 0;
        if(num1> num2){
            max = num1;
        }else {
            max = num2;
        }
        print("The greatest number is $max");
        }

        Show Output
        The greatest number is 15


    Example 1: Using Ternary Operator
    This program finds greatest number between two numbers using ternary operator.

    void main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 15;
    int max = (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;
    print("The greatest number is $max");
    }

    Show Output
    The greatest number is 15
    
    Note: Ternary operator makes if-else code much shorter and readable. If you have problems with ternary, you can always use if-else.        

Example 2: Ternary Operator Dart
    If the selection value is 2 then it will set output as Apple otherwise, Banana.

    void main() {
    var selection = 2;
    var output = (selection == 2) ? 'Apple' : 'Banana';
    print(output);
    }

    Show Output
    Apple    


Example 3 Ternary Operator Dart
    This is a dart program to print whether the person is a voter or not using a ternary operator.

    void main() {
    var age = 18;
    var check = (age >= 18) ? 'You ara a voter.' : 'You are not a voter.';
    print(check);
    }

    Show Output
    You ara a voter.
