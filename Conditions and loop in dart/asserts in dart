Assert:
    While coding, it is hard to find errors in big projects, so dart provide a assert method to check for the error. It takes conditions as an argument. If the condition is true, nothing happens. If a condition is false, it will raise an error.targets
    
    You can use assert without a custom message or with a custom message.
    Syntax:

        assert(condition);
        // or 
        assert(condition, "Your custom message");

Example 1: How To Use Assert In Dart Program:
    This example shows how you can use assert with a custom message.

        void main() { 
        var age = 22;
        assert(age!=22, "Age must be 22");
        }
        
        Show Output
        Uncaught Error: Assertion failed: "Age must be 22"
