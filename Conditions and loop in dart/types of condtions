Conditions In Dart:
    When you write a computer program, you need to be able to tell the computer what to do in different situations. With conditions, you can control the flow of the dart program. Suppose you need to execute a specific code when a particular situation is true. In that case, you can use conditions in Dart. E.g., a calculator app must perform subtraction if the user presses the subtract button and addition if the user taps the add button.

Types Of Condition:
    You can use following conditions to control the flow of your program.

    If Condition
    If-Else Condition
    If-Else-If Condition
    Switch case

    If Condition:
        The easy and most common way of controlling the flow of a program is through the use of an if statement. If statement allow us to execute a code block when the given condition is true. Conditions evaluate boolean values.

        Example Of If Condition:
        It prints whether the person is a voter. If the personâ€™s age is greater and equal to 18, it will print, You are a voter.

            void main()
            {
                var age = 20;
                
                if(age >= 18){
                print("You are voter.");
                }
            }

            Show Output
            You are voter.        


    If-Else Condition:

        If the result of the condition is true, then the body of the if-condition is executed. Otherwise, the body of the else-condition is executed.

        Example Of If-Else Condition
        Dart program prints whether the person is a voter or not based on age.

        void main(){
                int age = 12;
                if(age >= 18){
                    print("You are voter.");
                }else{
                    print("You are not voter.");
                }
            }


    Condition Based On Boolean Value:
        If the married status is false, it prints you are single; otherwise, it will print you are married.

        void main(){
                bool isMarried = false;
                if(isMarried){
                    print("You are married.");
                }else{
                    print("You are single.");
                }
        }


    If-Else-If Condition:
        When you have multiple if conditions, then you can use if-else-if. You can learn more in the example below. When you have more than two conditions, you can use if, else if, else in dart.

            void main() {
                int noOfMonth = 5;

                // Check the no of month
                if (noOfMonth == 1) {
                    print("The month is jan");
                } else if (noOfMonth == 2) {
                    print("The month is feb");
                } else if (noOfMonth == 3) {
                    print("The month is march");
                } else if (noOfMonth == 4) {
                    print("The month is april");
                } else if (noOfMonth == 5) {
                    print("The month is may");
                } else if (noOfMonth == 6) {
                    print("The month is june");          
                } else if (noOfMonth == 12) {
                    print("The month is dec");
                } else {
                    print("Invalid option given.");
                }
            }
