Arrow Function In Dart:
    Dart has a special syntax for the function body, which is only one line. The arrow function is represented by => symbol. It is a shorthand syntax for any function that has only one expression.

Syntax:
    returnType functionName(parameters...) => expression;

Note: The arrow function is used to make your code short.=> expr syntax is a shorthand for { return expr; }.

Example 1: 
Simple Interest Without Arrow Function

    This program finds simple interest without using the arrow function.

        // function that calculate interest
        double calculateInterest(double principal, double rate, double time) {
            double interest = principal * rate * time / 100;
            return interest;
        }

        void main() {
            double principal = 5000;
            double time = 3;
            double rate = 3;

            double result = calculateInterest(principal, rate, time);
            print("The simple interest is $result.");
        }

    Example 2:
    Simple Interest With Arrow Function

        This program finds simple interest using the arrow function.

        // arrow function that calculate interest
        double calculateInterest(double principal, double rate, double time) =>
            principal * rate * time / 100;

        void main() {
            double principal = 5000;
            double time = 3;
            double rate = 3;

            double result = calculateInterest(principal, rate, time);
            print("The simple interest is $result.");
        }

    Example 3: 
    Simple Calculation Using Arrow Function

    This program finds the sum, difference, multiplication, and division of two numbers using the arrow function.

        int add(int n1, int n2) => n1 + n2;
        int sub(int n1, int n2) => n1 - n2;

        void main() {
            int num1 = 100;
            int num2 = 30;

            print("The sum is ${add(num1, num2)}");
            print("The diff is ${sub(num1, num2)}");

        }
