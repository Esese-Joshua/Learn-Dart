Scope In Dart:
    The scope is a concept that refers to where values can be accessed or referenced. Dart uses curly braces {} to determine the scope of variables. If you define a variable inside curly braces, you can’t use it outside the curly braces.

Method Scope:
    If you created variables inside the method, you can use them inside the method block but not outside the method block.

    Example 1: 
    Method Scope

        void main() {
            String text = "I am text inside main. Anyone can't access me.";
            print(text);
        }


Global Scope:
    You can define a variable in the global scope to use the variable anywhere in your program.

    Example 1: 
    Global Scope
    
        String global = "I am Global. Anyone can access me.";
            void main() {
            print(global);
        }

        Note: Define your variable as much as close Local as you can. It makes your code clean and prevents you from using or changing them where you shouldn’t.
