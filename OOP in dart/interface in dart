Interface In Dart:
    An interface defines a syntax that a class must follow. It is a contract that defines the capabilities of a class. It is used to achieve abstraction in the Dart programming language. When you implement an interface, you must implement all the properties and methods defined in the interface. Keyword implements is used to implement an interface.

Syntax Of Interface In Dart:
    class InterfaceName {
        // code
    }

    class ClassName implements InterfaceName {
        // code
    }

Declaring Interface In Dart:
    In dart there is no keyword interface but you can use class or abstract class to declare an interface. All classes implicitly define an interface. Mostly abstract class is used to declare an interface.


    // creating an interface using abstract class
        abstract class Person {
        canWalk();
        canRun();
    }

Implementing Interface In Dart:
    You must use the implements keyword to implement an interface. The class that implements an interface must implement all the methods and properties of the interface.    

    class Student implements Person {
        // implementation of canWalk()
        @override
        canWalk() {
            print('Student can walk');
        }

        // implementation of canRun()
        @override
        canRun() {
            print('Student can run');
        }
    }


Note: Most of the time, abstract class is used instead of concrete class to declare an interface.
