Introduction:
    In this section, you will learn about constructor in Dart programming language and how to use constructors with the help of examples. Before learning about the constructor, you should have a basic understanding of the class and object in dart.

Constructor In Dart:
    A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object. It is called automatically when an object is created, and it can be used to set the initial values for the object’s properties. For example, the following code creates a Person class object and sets the initial values for the name and age properties.

Without Constructor:
    If you don’t define a constructor for class, then you need to set the values of the properties manually. For example, the following code creates a Person class object and sets the values for the name and age properties.

    Person person = Person();
    person.name = "John";
    person.age = 30;

    
Things To Remember:
    - The constructor’s name should be the same as the class name.
    - Constructor doesn’t have any return type.


Syntax:
    class ClassName {
    // Constructor declaration: Same as class name
    ClassName() {
        // body of the constructor
    }
    }
    targets

    
    Note: When you create a object of a class, the constructor is called automatically. It is used to initialize the values when an object is created.


How to declare Constructor in Dart: 
   In this example below, there is a class Student with three properties: name, age, and rollNumber. The class has one constructor. The constructor is used to initialize the values of the three properties. We also created an object of the class Student called student.

    class Student {
    String? name;
    int? age;
    int? rollNumber;

    // Constructor
    Student(String name, int age, int rollNumber) {
        print(
            "Constructor called"); // this is for checking the constructor is called or not.
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
    }
    }

    void main() {
    // Here student is object of class Student.
    Student student = Student("John", 20, 1);
    print("Name: ${student.name}");
    print("Age: ${student.age}");
    print("Roll Number: ${student.rollNumber}");
    }
