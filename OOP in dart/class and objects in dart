    class Animal {
    String? name;
    int? numberOfLegs;
    int? lifeSpan;

    void display() {
        print("Animal name: $name.");
        print("Number of Legs: $numberOfLegs.");
        print("Life Span: $lifeSpan.");
    }
    }

    void main(){
    // Here animal is object of class Animal. 
    Animal animal = Animal();
    animal.name = "Lion";
    animal.numberOfLegs = 4;
    animal.lifeSpan = 10;

    animal.display();
    }
