Enum In Dart:
    An enum is a special type that represents a fixed number of constant values. An enum is declared using the keyword enum followed by the enumâ€™s name.


In this example, there is an enum type named Gender. It contains three constants Male, Female, and Other. The Gender enum type is used in the Person class.

    enum Gender { Male, Female, Other }

    class Person {
      // Properties
      String? firstName;
      String? lastName;
      Gender? gender;

      // Constructor
      Person(this.firstName, this.lastName, this.gender);

      // display() method
      void display() {
        print("First Name: $firstName");
        print("Last Name: $lastName");
        print("Gender: $gender");
      }
    }

    void main() {
      Person p1 = Person("John", "Doe", Gender.Male);
      p1.display();

      Person p2 = Person("Menuka", "Sharma", Gender.Female);
      p2.display();
    }


  Show Output:
  First Name: John
  Last Name: Doe
  Gender: Gender.Male
  First Name: Menuka
  Last Name: Sharma
  Gender: Gender.Female
