Object In Dart:
    In object-oriented programming, an object is a self-contained unit of code and data. Objects are created from templates called classes. An object is made up of properties(variables) and methods(functions). An object is an instance of a class.

    For example, a bicycle object might have attributes like color, size, and current speed. It might have methods like changeGear, pedalFaster, and brake.

    Note: To create an object, you must create a class first. It’s a good practice to declare the object name in lower case.


Instantiation:
    In object-oriented programming, instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class. In other words, you can say that instantiation is the process of creating an object of a class. For example, if you have a class called Bicycle, then you can create an object of the class called bicycle.

Declaring an object in dart:
    In object-oriented programming, instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class. In other words, you can say that instantiation is the process of creating an object of a class. For example, if you have a class called Bicycle, then you can create an object of the class called bicycle.

    class Bicycle {
      String? color;
      int? size;
      int? currentSpeed;
    
      void changeGear(int newValue) {
        currentSpeed = newValue;
      }
    
      void display() {
        print("Color: $color");
        print("Size: $size");
        print("Current Speed: $currentSpeed");
      }
    }

    void main(){
        // Here bicycle is object of class Bicycle. 
        Bicycle bicycle = Bicycle();
        bicycle.color = "Red";
        bicycle.size = 26;
        bicycle.currentSpeed = 0;
        bicycle.changeGear(5);
        bicycle.display();
    }

    Show Output:
    Color: Red
    Size: 26
    Current Speed: 5
    
    Note: Once you create an object, you can access the properties and methods of the object using the dot(.) operator.


Key Points:
    - The main method is the program’s entry point, so it is always needed to see the result.
    - The new keyword can be used to create a new object, but it is unnecessary.
