Class In Dart:
    In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties and methods that an object will have. For example, a class called Dog might have properties like breed, color and methods like bark, run.

Declaring Class In Dart:
    You can declare a class in dart using the class keyword followed by class name and braces {}. Itâ€™s a good habit to write class name in PascalCase. For example, Employee, Student, QuizBrain, etc.


In this example below, there is class Animal with three properties: name, numberOfLegs, and lifeSpan. The class also has a method called display, which prints out the values of the three properties.

    class Animal {
    String? name;
    int? numberOfLegs;
    int? lifeSpan;

    void display() {
        print("Animal name: $name.");
        print("Number of Legs: $numberOfLegs.");
        print("Life Span: $lifeSpan.");
    }
    }
    
        Note: This program will not print anything because we have not created any object of the class. You will learn about the object later. The ? is used for null safety. You will also learn about null safety later.
